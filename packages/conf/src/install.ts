    option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed names are used. At
    installation time, systemctl enable will create symlinks from these names to the unit
    filename. Note that not all unit types support such alias names, and this setting is
    not supported for them. Specifically, mount, slice, swap, and automount units do not
    support aliasing.

  /**
  WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, UpheldBy=
    This option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list of unit names may be
    given. A symbolic link is created in the .wants/, .requires/, or .upholds/ directory
    of each of the listed units when this unit is installed by systemctl enable. This has
    the effect of a dependency of type Wants=, Requires=, or Upholds= being added from the
    listed unit to the current unit. See the description of the mentioned dependency types
    in the [Unit] section for details.

    In case of template units listing non template units, the listing unit must have
    DefaultInstance= set, or systemctl enable must be called with an instance name. The
    instance (default or specified) will be added to the .wants/, .requires/, or .upholds/
    list of the listed unit. For example, WantedBy=getty.target in a service
    getty@.service will result in systemctl enable getty@tty2.service creating a
    getty.target.wants/getty@tty2.service link to getty@.service. This also applies to
    listing specific instances of templated units: this specific instance will gain the
    dependency. A template unit may also list a template unit, in which case a generic
    dependency will be added where each instance of the listing unit will have a
    dependency on an instance of the listed template with the same instance value. For
    example, WantedBy=container@.target in a service monitor@.service will result in
    systemctl enable monitor@.service creating a container@.target.wants/monitor@.service
    link to monitor@.service, which applies to all instances of container@.target.
