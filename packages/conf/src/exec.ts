    root user (services managed by root's instance of systemd --user), the default is
    "root", but User= may be used to specify a different user. For user services of any
    other user, switching user identity is not permitted, hence the only valid setting is
    the same user the user's service manager is running as. If no group is set, the
    default group of the user is used. This setting does not affect commands whose command
    line is prefixed with "+".

    Note that this enforces only weak restrictions on the user/group name syntax, but will
    generate warnings in many cases where user/group names do not adhere to the following
    rules: the specified name should consist only of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, "_" and
    "-", except for the first character which must be one of a-z, A-Z and "_" (i.e. digits
    and "-" are not permitted as first character). The user/group name must have at least
    one character, and at most 31. These restrictions are made in order to avoid
    ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux
    systems. For further details on the names accepted and the names warned about see
    User/Group Name Syntax[3].

    When used in conjunction with DynamicUser= the user/group name specified is

    DynamicUser= is not used the specified user and group must have been created
    statically in the user database no later than the moment the service is started, for
    example using the sysusers.d(5) facility, which is applied at boot or package install
    time. If the user does not exist by then program invocation will fail.

    If the User= setting is used the supplementary group list is initialized from the

    users/groups into the system's user and group databases. The user and group name to

    specified and the static user with the name exists, then it is required that the
    static group with the name already exists. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the
    UID/GID range 61184...65519. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system
    or login users. At any point in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to
    zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use. However, UID/GIDs are recycled
    after a unit is terminated. Care should be taken that any processes running as part of
    a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories
    owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID
    assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories. If DynamicUser=
    is enabled, RemoveIPC= and PrivateTmp= are implied (and cannot be turned off). This
    ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed
    processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the
    dynamic user/group. Since /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ are usually the only world-writable
    directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group
    allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination. Furthermore
    NoNewPrivileges= and RestrictSUIDSGID= are implicitly enabled (and cannot be
    disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID
    files or directories. Moreover ProtectSystem=strict and ProtectHome=read-only are
    implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations. In
    order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be
    allow-listed using ReadWritePaths=, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling
    doesn't create security issues involving files created by the service. Use
    RuntimeDirectory= (see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a
    service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is
    terminated. Use StateDirectory=, CacheDirectory= and LogsDirectory= in order to assign
    a set of writable directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they
    are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see below). If this option is
    enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do not get access to
    directories outside of these explicitly configured and managed ones. Specifically, do
    not use BindPaths= and be careful with AF_UNIX file descriptor passing for directory
    file descriptors, as this would permit processes to create files or directories owned
    by the dynamic user/group that are not subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees
    of the service. Note that this option is currently incompatible with D-Bus policies,
    thus a service using this option may currently not allocate a D-Bus service name (note
    that this does not affect calling into other D-Bus services). Defaults to off.

    session will be opened for the executed processes. See pam(8) for details.

    Note that for each unit making use of this option a PAM session handler process will
    be maintained as part of the unit and stays around as long as the unit is active, to
    ensure that appropriate actions can be taken when the unit and hence the PAM session
    terminates. This process is named "(sd-pam)" and is an immediate child process of the
    unit's main process.

    Note that when this option is used for a unit it is very likely (depending on PAM
    configuration) that the main unit process will be migrated to its own session scope
    unit when it is activated. This process will hence be associated with two units: the
    unit it was originally started from (and for which PAMName= was configured), and the
    session scope unit. Any child processes of that process will however be associated
    with the session scope unit only. This has implications when used in combination with
    NotifyAccess=all, as these child processes will not be able to affect changes in the
    original unit through notification messages. These messages will be considered
    belonging to the session scope unit and not the original unit. It is hence not
    recommended to use PAMName= in combination with NotifyAccess=all.

  LimitCPU=, LimitFSIZE=, LimitDATA=, LimitSTACK=, LimitCORE=, LimitRSS=, LimitNOFILE=,
  LimitAS=, LimitNPROC=, LimitMEMLOCK=, LimitLOCKS=, LimitSIGPENDING=, LimitMSGQUEUE=,
  LimitNICE=, LimitRTPRIO=, LimitRTTIME=
    Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit(2)
    for details on the process resource limit concept. Process resource limits may be
    specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit
    to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits
    individually (e.g.  "LimitAS=4G:16G"). Use the string infinity to configure no limit
    on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base
    1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g.  "LimitAS=16G"). For the
    limits referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be
    used (see systemd.time(7) for details). Note that if no time unit is specified for
    LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default
    unit of microseconds is implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the
    limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified for
    LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value
    may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood
    as regular Linux nice value in the range -20...19. If not prefixed like this the value
    is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0...40 (with 0 being
    equivalent to 1).

    Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process,
    and processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted
    independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set. Also note that
    LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is
    advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in systemd.resource-control(5) over
    these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered
    dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is
    a more powerful (and working) replacement for LimitRSS=.

    Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not
    the number of processes started (forked) by the service. Therefore the limit is
    cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
    LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping
    privileges). Due to these limitations, TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control(5)) is
    typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.

    Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured
    in the various DefaultLimitCPU=, DefaultLimitFSIZE=, ... options available in systemd-
    system.conf(5), and – if not configured there – the kernel or per-user defaults, as
    defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).

    For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are
    configured in a user service (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the
    service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for the user
    manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally
    lacks the privileges to do so. In user context these configuration options are hence
    only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit to the maximum of
    the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the
    available configuration mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically
    require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure higher per-user resource
    limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's
    service manager, i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes,
    make sure to restart the user's service manager.

    value is inherited from the per-user service manager (whose default is in turn
    inherited from the system service manager, and thus typically also is 0022 — unless
    overridden by a PAM module). In order to change the per-user mask for all user

    service instance. The per-user umask may also be set via the umask field of a user's
    JSON User Record[5] (for users managed by systemd-homed.service(8) this field may be

      private-anonymous, shared-anonymous, private-file-backed, shared-file-backed,
      elf-headers, private-huge, shared-huge, private-dax, shared-dax, and the special

  KeyringMode=
    Controls how the kernel session keyring is set up for the service (see session-
    keyring(7) for details on the session keyring). Takes one of inherit, private, shared.
    If set to inherit no special keyring setup is done, and the kernel's default behaviour
    is applied. If private is used a new session keyring is allocated when a service
    process is invoked, and it is not linked up with any user keyring. This is the
    recommended setting for system services, as this ensures that multiple services
    running under the same system user ID (in particular the root user) do not share their
    key material among each other. If shared is used a new session keyring is allocated as
    for private, but the user keyring of the user configured with User= is linked into it,
    so that keys assigned to the user may be requested by the unit's processes. In this
    mode multiple units running processes under the same user ID may share key material.
    Unless inherit is selected the unique invocation ID for the unit (see below) is added
    as a protected key by the name "invocation_id" to the newly created session keyring.

    memory pressure very likely). See The /proc Filesystem[6] for details. If not

    x86, x86-64, ppc, ppc-le, ppc64, ppc64-le, s390 or s390x. Which personality
    architectures are supported depends on the kernel's native architecture. Usually the
    64-bit versions of the various system architectures support their immediate 32-bit
    personality architecture counterpart, but no others. For example, x86-64 systems
    support the x86-64 and x86 personalities but no others. The personality feature is
    useful when running 32-bit services on a 64-bit host system. If not specified, the
    personality is left unmodified and thus reflects the personality of the host system's
    kernel. This option is not useful on architectures for which only one native word
    width was ever available, such as m68k (32-bit only) or alpha (64-bit only).

  /**
   * ENVIRONMENT
   */

  /**
  Environment=
    Sets environment variables for executed processes. Each line is unquoted using the
    rules described in "Quoting" section in systemd.syntax(7) and becomes a list of
    variable assignments. If you need to assign a value containing spaces or the equals
    sign to a variable, put quotes around the whole assignment. Variable expansion is not
    performed inside the strings and the "$" character has no special meaning. Specifier
    expansion is performed, see the "Specifiers" section in systemd.unit(5).

    This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will
    be set. If the same variable is listed twice, the later setting will override the
    earlier setting. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of
    environment variables is reset, all prior assignments have no effect.

    The names of the variables can contain ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore
    character. Variable names cannot be empty or start with a digit. In variable values,
    most characters are allowed, but non-printable characters are currently rejected.

    Example:

        Environment="VAR1=word1 word2" VAR2=word3 "VAR3=$word 5 6"

    gives three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3" with the values "word1 word2", "word3",
    "$word 5 6".

    See environ(7) for details about environment variables.

    Note that environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets (such as
    passwords, key material, ...) to service processes. Environment variables set for a
    unit are exposed to unprivileged clients via D-Bus IPC, and generally not understood
    as being data that requires protection. Moreover, environment variables are propagated
    down the process tree, including across security boundaries (such as setuid/setgid
    executables), and hence might leak to processes that should not have access to the
    secret data. Use LoadCredential=, LoadCredentialEncrypted= or SetCredentialEncrypted=
    (see below) to pass data to unit processes securely.
  */
  Environment?: string[] | string;

  /**
  EnvironmentFile=
    Similar to Environment=, but reads the environment variables from a text file. The
    text file should contain newline-separated variable assignments. Empty lines, lines
    without an "=" separator, or lines starting with ";" or "#" will be ignored, which may
    be used for commenting. The file must be encoded with UTF-8. Valid characters are
    unicode scalar values[8] other than unicode noncharacters[9], U+0000 NUL, and U+FEFF
    unicode byte order mark[10]. Control codes other than NUL are allowed.

    In the file, an unquoted value after the "=" is parsed with the same backslash-escape
    rules as POSIX shell unquoted text[11], but unlike in a shell, interior whitespace is
    preserved and quotes after the first non-whitespace character are preserved. Leading
    and trailing whitespace (space, tab, carriage return) is discarded, but interior
    whitespace within the line is preserved verbatim. A line ending with a backslash will
    be continued to the following one, with the newline itself discarded. A backslash "\"
    followed by any character other than newline will preserve the following character, so
    that "\\" will become the value "\".

    In the file, a "'"-quoted value after the "=" can span multiple lines and contain any
    character verbatim other than single quote, like POSIX shell single-quoted text[12].
    No backslash-escape sequences are recognized. Leading and trailing whitespace outside
    of the single quotes is discarded.

    In the file, a """-quoted value after the "=" can span multiple lines, and the same
    escape sequences are recognized as in POSIX shell double-quoted text[13]. Backslash
    ("\") followed by any of ""\`$" will preserve that character. A backslash followed by
    newline is a line continuation, and the newline itself is discarded. A backslash
    followed by any other character is ignored; both the backslash and the following
    character are preserved verbatim. Leading and trailing whitespace outside of the
    double quotes is discarded.

    The argument passed should be an absolute filename or wildcard expression, optionally
    prefixed with "-", which indicates that if the file does not exist, it will not be
    read and no error or warning message is logged. This option may be specified more than
    once in which case all specified files are read. If the empty string is assigned to
    this option, the list of file to read is reset, all prior assignments have no effect.

    The files listed with this directive will be read shortly before the process is
    executed (more specifically, after all processes from a previous unit state
    terminated. This means you can generate these files in one unit state, and read it
    with this option in the next. The files are read from the file system of the service
    manager, before any file system changes like bind mounts take place).

    Settings from these files override settings made with Environment=. If the same
    variable is set twice from these files, the files will be read in the order they are
    specified and the later setting will override the earlier setting.
  */
  EnvironmentFile?: string[] | string;

  /**
  PassEnvironment=
    Pass environment variables set for the system service manager to executed processes.
    Takes a space-separated list of variable names. This option may be specified more than
    once, in which case all listed variables will be passed. If the empty string is
    assigned to this option, the list of environment variables to pass is reset, all prior
    assignments have no effect. Variables specified that are not set for the system
    manager will not be passed and will be silently ignored. Note that this option is only
    relevant for the system service manager, as system services by default do not
    automatically inherit any environment variables set for the service manager itself.
    However, in case of the user service manager all environment variables are passed to
    the executed processes anyway, hence this option is without effect for the user
    service manager.

    Variables set for invoked processes due to this setting are subject to being
    overridden by those configured with Environment= or EnvironmentFile=.

    Example:

        PassEnvironment=VAR1 VAR2 VAR3

    passes three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3" with the values set for those variables
    in PID1.

    See environ(7) for details about environment variables.

    Added in version 228.
  */
  PassEnvironment?: string[] | string;

  /**
  UnsetEnvironment=
    Explicitly unset environment variable assignments that would normally be passed from
    the service manager to invoked processes of this unit. Takes a space-separated list of
    variable names or variable assignments. This option may be specified more than once,
    in which case all listed variables/assignments will be unset. If the empty string is
    assigned to this option, the list of environment variables/assignments to unset is
    reset. If a variable assignment is specified (that is: a variable name, followed by
    "=", followed by its value), then any environment variable matching this precise
    assignment is removed. If a variable name is specified (that is a variable name
    without any following "=" or value), then any assignment matching the variable name,
    regardless of its value is removed. Note that the effect of UnsetEnvironment= is
    applied as final step when the environment list passed to executed processes is
    compiled. That means it may undo assignments from any configuration source, including
    assignments made through Environment= or EnvironmentFile=, inherited from the system
    manager's global set of environment variables, inherited via PassEnvironment=, set by
    the service manager itself (such as $NOTIFY_SOCKET and such), or set by a PAM module
    (in case PAMName= is used).

    See "Environment Variables in Spawned Processes" below for a description of how those
    settings combine to form the inherited environment. See environ(7) for general
    information about environment variables.
