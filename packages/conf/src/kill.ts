/**
  Unit configuration files for services, sockets, mount points, swap devices and scopes
  share a subset of configuration options which define the killing procedure of processes
  belonging to the unit.

  This man page lists the configuration options shared by these five unit types. See
  systemd.unit(5) for the common options shared by all unit configuration files, and
  systemd.service(5), systemd.socket(5), systemd.swap(5), systemd.mount(5) and
  systemd.scope(5) for more information on the configuration file options specific to each
  unit type.

  The kill procedure configuration options are configured in the [Service], [Socket],
  [Mount] or [Swap] section, depending on the unit type.

 * @see https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man5/systemd.kill.5.html

  /**
  KillMode=
    Specifies how processes of this unit shall be killed. One of control-group, mixed,
    process, none.

    If set to control-group, all remaining processes in the control group of this unit
    will be killed on unit stop (for services: after the stop command is executed, as
    configured with ExecStop=). If set to mixed, the SIGTERM signal (see below) is sent to
    the main process while the subsequent SIGKILL signal (see below) is sent to all
    remaining processes of the unit's control group. If set to process, only the main
    process itself is killed (not recommended!). If set to none, no process is killed
    (strongly recommended against!). In this case, only the stop command will be executed
    on unit stop, but no process will be killed otherwise. Processes remaining alive after
    stop are left in their control group and the control group continues to exist after
    stop unless empty.

    Note that it is not recommended to set KillMode= to process or even none, as this
    allows processes to escape the service manager's lifecycle and resource management,
    and to remain running even while their service is considered stopped and is assumed to
    not consume any resources.

    Processes will first be terminated via SIGTERM (unless the signal to send is changed
    via KillSignal= or RestartKillSignal=). Optionally, this is immediately followed by a
    SIGHUP (if enabled with SendSIGHUP=). If processes still remain after:

    •   the main process of a unit has exited (applies to KillMode=: mixed)

    •   the delay configured via the TimeoutStopSec= has passed (applies to KillMode=:
        control-group, mixed, process)

    the termination request is repeated with the SIGKILL signal or the signal specified
    via FinalKillSignal= (unless this is disabled via the SendSIGKILL= option). See
    kill(2) for more information.

    Defaults to control-group.
